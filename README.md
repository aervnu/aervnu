### About me

- üåç First off, let me introduce myself. I'm Khanh, commonly known as Andy globally. I'm a Vietnamese person born in 2007. Briefly saying, I have considerable knowledge about computer usage and troubleshooting (In the very case that your definition of 'considerable' is different, let me know. I like people who think differently from everyone else in this world.). Still learning to code though, read below for more information. I am also a VERY IRRESPONSIBLE person.

- :telescope: Well...I'm a student. A high school student. I don't usually work except in summer holidays where I work as an intern in the IT helpdesk in my dad's company. (psst...I earn $2 hourly there dealing with eye-gourging cases of malfunctioning client computers.)

- :seedling: I'm learning C++ and C#.

- :zap: I usually write code, read tech articles, and play games (especially Geometry Dash and MSFS20) in my free time. Or I just design and render random stuff on my workstation.

- üåê You might be interested in the computer browsers I use. No offense, but only Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge provide sufficient security. Not a Google or Microsoft fanboy or anything, but browsers like Brave literally redirects you to their crypto BS, Vivaldi just being a reskinned version of Chrome, and Firefox with their HORRIBLE sandboxing-container tabs are kinda worthless, at least until version 95-we'll wait and see. Edge has proper sandboxing and nice security mitigations and if you're not fine with any website breaking then there's the whitelist for you.

Again this isn't me fanboying any companies. These are simply facts I collected. I don't talk customizability with people that can't be bothered to waste a few mouseclicks shutting off unnecessary features.
