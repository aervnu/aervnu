### About me

- üåç First off, let me introduce myself. I'm Khanh, commonly known as Andy globally. I'm a Vietnamese person born in 2007. Briefly saying, I have considerable knowledge about computer usage and troubleshooting (In the very case that your definition of 'considerable' is different, let me know. I like people who think differently from everyone else in this world.). Still learning to code though, read below for more information. I am also a VERY IRRESPONSIBLE person.

- :telescope: Well...I'm a student. Jobless for now. I'll continue throughout university, I suppose.

- :seedling: I'm learning C++ and C#.

- :atom: I usually write code, read tech articles, and play games (MSFS20 & HSR) in my free time.

- üì∏ I've also taken up photography as well, and I main landscape plus macro and portrait.
